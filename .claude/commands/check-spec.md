description: Check if implementation matches specification
---

Compare implementation against specification to find discrepancies.

Steps:

1. Read the spec file for {{arg1}} in `docs/specs/`
2. Find the corresponding implementation in `packages/`
3. Compare implementation against spec requirements
4. List any missing features or deviations
5. Suggest changes to align with spec

Example usage:

- `/check-spec dsl-grammar-spec` - Check parser implementations against grammar
- `/check-spec type-mapping-spec` - Check type mapping implementation
