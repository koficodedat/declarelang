description: Implement a feature from specification
---

Implement a feature by reading its specification first, then writing the code.

Steps:

1. Read the relevant spec file in `docs/specs/` for {{arg1}}
2. Check if related code already exists in `packages/`
3. Create a todo list for the implementation
4. Implement following the spec precisely
5. Write tests (80% coverage target)
6. Run typecheck and tests
7. Update CLAUDE.md if adding new patterns

Example usage:

- `/impl-spec ddl-parser` - Implement DDL parser from spec
- `/impl-spec type-mapping` - Implement type mapping system
